# The Star And Thank Author License (SATA License)

This is a novel new idea to make license social and fun.

The basic idea is, whenever using a project using SATA license, people should star/like/+1 that project and thank the author. Just imagine Google stared your project and send you a thank-you letter because they used your project in github!

## How to use

Here is the template of the [Star And Thank Author License](LICENSE-template.txt) sublicensed from [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Just copy the template and modify the author and project url section.

You can also customize by sublicensing other licenses such as [GPL](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license).

I've written a blog post about [Star And Thank Author License](LICENSE-template.txt).

## License

Notice that this [SATA-License](https://github.com/zTrix/sata-license) project is also using [SATA license](LICENSE.txt) (self-referencing, recursive, cool?), which means to use SATA license, you have to star this project.
